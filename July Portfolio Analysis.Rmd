The fund invests in companies across various sectors such as technology, financials, and consumer discretionary in developing nations. Offers diversified access to growth opportunities in emerging economies through a passive indexing approach.",
    
    "Invests in companies involved in defence and cyber defence spending across NATO and NATO+ allied countries, capitalizing on increased military expenditure globally. Holdings include major defence contractors like Palantir Technologies, Rheinmetall, and RTX Corporation focusing on military technology and equipment. The fund benefits from geopolitical tensions driving higher defence budgets and modernization programs across Western nations.",
    
    "Provides exposure to a broad basket of commodity futures including energy (crude oil, natural gas), precious metals (gold, silver), industrial metals (copper, aluminum), and agricultural products. The fund tracks the Bloomberg Commodity Index, offering diversified commodity exposure without direct physical ownership of the underlying assets. Serves as an inflation hedge and portfolio diversifier, particularly during periods of rising commodity prices and economic uncertainty.",
    
    "Tracks the MSCI World Index, investing in large and mid-cap developed market equities across 23 countries including the US, Japan, UK, and continental Europe. The fund provides broad exposure to global developed market companies across all sectors, with significant weightings in technology, financials, and healthcare. Offers GBP-hedged exposure to reduce currency risk for UK investors while maintaining global equity market diversification.",
    
    "Follows a minimum volatility strategy within the MSCI World Index, selecting stocks with lower historical volatility to reduce portfolio risk while maintaining developed market exposure. The fund tilts toward defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare while underweighting more volatile growth sectors. Aims to provide smoother returns than the broader market while still capturing long-term equity growth potential.",
    
    "Implements a value investment strategy by selecting stocks from the MSCI World Index that exhibit value characteristics such as low price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. The fund focuses on companies that appear undervalued relative to their fundamentals, including mature companies in sectors like financials, energy, and industrials. Provides exposure to the value factor premium while maintaining global developed market diversification.",
    
    "Holds physical gold bullion stored in secure vaults, providing direct exposure to gold price movements without the complexities of futures contracts or mining stocks. The fund offers a way to invest in gold as a portfolio hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty. Each share represents a fractional ownership of actual gold, making it a pure play on precious metals investing."
